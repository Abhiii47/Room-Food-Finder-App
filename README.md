Room & Food Finder
A full-stack web application designed to help new students find local room and food services.

This project is a complete, scalable platform for connecting students with local vendors. It is built as a monorepo, containing both the frontend and backend in a single repository for streamlined development and deployment.

âœ¨ Project Highlights
User-Centric Design: The frontend offers a clean, responsive UI that works seamlessly across all devices.

Secure Authentication: The backend provides a secure system for user registration and login, with password hashing and JWT-based sessions.

Data Management: A robust Node.js server with a MongoDB database for managing user accounts, vendor information, and listing data.

Real-time Features: The project includes the foundation for real-time chat functionality using Socket.IO.

Organized Codebase: The codebase is split into distinct frontend and backend directories for clear separation of concerns.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
Frontend
React: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

React Router: Manages navigation and routing within the application.

Axios: Used for making API calls to the backend.

HTML & CSS: Custom styling for a unique and appealing design.

Backend
Node.js & Express: The server-side environment and web framework.

MongoDB & Mongoose: A NoSQL database and an ODM for data modeling.

bcryptjs & jsonwebtoken: For user authentication and session management.
